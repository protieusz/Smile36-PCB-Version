# Smile36-PCB-Version
Converted From Handwire To PCB Using EasyEDA

Current Rev 5 pcb has fixed the issues of Rev 1 and also by adding multi layer pads, thru holes for the mcu solder pads, larger pads for easier soldering, added more screw holes in the middle of the pcb so less flexy and stability.  However the Rev 5 pcbs will be untested since I do not have the funds to do a re-print.  Hence the are for public and print, use for at your own risks!  Don't come to me and bitch about it.  It is what it is. No support will be given. Having said that the Rev 5 pcb should work.  Auto routed and not DRC errors. Good luck and have fun.

Rev 1: My very 1st pcb design, forgot that smd pads only works on 1 layer and not both layers so all my rows are not connected, so had to salvaged it by handwired it to the mcu and it works.
