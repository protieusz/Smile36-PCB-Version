# Smile36-PCB-Version

I accept any tips or donations of a cup of coffee to help keep me motivate but you don't have to if you don't want to. Thanks. https://ko-fi.com/protieusz

Update Aug 25, 2025. Got sponsored by <img width="500" height="137" alt="PCBWay" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36bd508a-a805-42f2-813d-c35cd24b7561" /> for PETG print for my new case design of Smile 36 "Chatacabra" from Monster Hunter Wilds.

PCBWay:
For all you 3D printing needs, PCBWay got all types of materials for your printing needs. Ranging from PLA to Resin, https://www.pcbway.com/rapid-prototyping/3d-printing/ for more info. Quality check by PCWay was very good. Their engineer will notify you if you have thin walls in your design and if you want to "risk" printing it. Printed items arrived with quality packing to ensure no damage or scratches during transport. Well worth it. Printing of my PETG for top and bottom case took around 1 day and ship out on the same day via UPS. The item was shipped out on Friday and arrived to my home address on the next Monday. Print quality is very good, rigid and no scratches. Thank you PCBWay!

Smile 36 Chatacabra Pics:
Chatacabra image was borrowed from https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/jewelry/chatacabra-keychain-mh-wilds-chatacabra-llavero-monster-hunter by NOGARDLABS. Please support & buy his keychain STL files for 3D print. The design was cleaned up very nicely so that it was easily incorporated into my custom keeb design. The design was modified to have the keychain hole removed.

The acrylic paint doesn't go smooth on the PETG material but still looks good.

A special thank you to [![PCBWay](https://github.com/protieusz/Smile36-PCB-Version/assets/118025702/3fe17713-d683-44ef-8f50-1d097865489f)](https://www.pcbway.com) for sponsoring my Rev 8 of the Smile 36 GRIN layout keyboard that has every thing working compared to Rev 1 which has the issue of the rows not working.  

Initial order arrived with easily scratch matte black silk screen on all 5 pcbs.  Functionality wise, the pcb work with no issues, continuity check outs. I reported the issues to the representative for my sponsorship and he was kind enough to replace the whole order with a new color pcb of my choice and so I picked purple.  Around 1 week ish, my pcb reprints enter production and was shipped by DHL free of charge to my address.  The results were awesome.  The purple pcbs were bright in color, shiny and the outline cuts were smooth with no sharp edges.  Ordering the pcbs from PCBWay was very easy.  You just specify the pcb dimensions, the pcb thickness, the color you want and leave most of the settings to default.  After you uploaded the gerber files, the status will be in review and an engineer will review your designs and goes into production when it is a passed.  Shipping wise, it has very many options ranging for express to budget shipping.  Prices are in USDs. Here is the direct link for ordering from PCBWay. [(https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Smile_36_GRIN_Layout_Custom_Keyboard_1b3776b9.html)].  Rev 8 gerber files will be upload to Github soon or you can download from the PCBWay link.

The following are the pictures of my brand new Smile 36 Rev 8 with no more handwiring fixes.

Some hiccup accident while soldering the mcu. Mcu was soldered on the wrong side. Tried hot plate and hot air and the damn mcu pcb will not come off. All the mcu components came off.
So then I gave up on desoldering the mcu and soldered a new mcu on the correct side and it works. There is hope if you have accidentally "F" up on the mcu. My top and bottom case was created
to accomodate 2 mcu soldered on top and bottom side of the Smile36 PCB. Just make sure you desolder all the components on the mcu PCB and use a yellow tape to prevent any future shorts.

Converted From Handwire To PCB Using EasyEDA

Current Rev 5 pcb has fixed the issues of Rev 1 and also by adding multi layer pads, thru holes for the mcu solder pads, larger pads for easier soldering, added more screw holes in the middle of the pcb so less flexy and stability.  However the Rev 5 pcbs will be untested since I do not have the funds to do a re-print.  Hence the are for public and print, use for at your own risks!  Don't come to me and bitch about it.  It is what it is. No support will be given. Having said that the Rev 5 pcb should work.  Auto routed and no DRC errors. Good luck and have fun.

Added a case STEP file that was used for handwire version. Please modify the STEP file to match the pcb version.

Rev 6 top:

Rev 6 bottom:

Rev 1: My very 1st pcb design, forgot that smd pads only works on 1 layer and not both layers so all my rows are not connected, so had to salvaged it by handwired it to the mcu and it works.
