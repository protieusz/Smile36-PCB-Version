 # Smile36-PCB-Version

Update: July 7, 2023

A special thank you to [![PCBWay](https://github.com/protieusz/Smile36-PCB-Version/assets/118025702/3fe17713-d683-44ef-8f50-1d097865489f)](https://www.pcbway.com) for sponsoring my Rev 8 of the Smile 36 GRIN layout keyboard that has every thing working compared to Rev 1 which has the issue of the rows not working.  

Initial order arrived with easily scratch matte black silk screen on all 5 pcbs.  Functionality wise, the pcb work with no issues, continuity check outs. I reported the issues to the representative of for my sponsorship and he was kind enough to replace the whole order with a new color pcb of my choice and so I picked purple.  Around 1 week ish, my pcb reprints enter production and was shipped by DHL free of charge to my address.  The results were awesome.  The purple pcbs were bright in color, shiny and the outline cuts were smooth with no sharp edges.  Ordering the pcbs from PCBWay was very easy.  You just specify the pcb dimensions, the pcb thickness, the color you want and leave most of the settings to default.  After you upload the gerber files, the status will be in review and an engineer will review your designs and go into production when it is a passed.  Shipping wise, it has very many options ranging for express to budget shipping.  Prices are in USDs. Here is the direct link for ordering from PCBWay. [(https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Smile_36_GRIN_Layout_Custom_Keyboard_1b3776b9.html)].  Rev 8 gerber files will be upload to Github soon or you can download from the PCBWay link.

The following are the pictures of my brand new Smile 36 Rev 8 with no more handwiring fixes.

Final Smile 36 with no case yet.

Converted From Handwire To PCB Using EasyEDA

Current Rev 5 pcb has fixed the issues of Rev 1 and also by adding multi layer pads, thru holes for the mcu solder pads, larger pads for easier soldering, added more screw holes in the middle of the pcb so less flexy and stability.  However the Rev 5 pcbs will be untested since I do not have the funds to do a re-print.  Hence the are for public and print, use for at your own risks!  Don't come to me and bitch about it.  It is what it is. No support will be given. Having said that the Rev 5 pcb should work.  Auto routed and no DRC errors. Good luck and have fun.

Added a case STEP file that was used for handwire version. Please modify the STEP file to match the pcb version.

Rev 1: My very 1st pcb design, forgot that smd pads only works on 1 layer and not both layers so all my rows are not connected, so had to salvaged it by handwired it to the mcu and it works.
